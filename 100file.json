{"abstract": "  A fully differential calculation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics is\npresented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. All\nnext-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark,\ngluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as\nall-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at\nnext-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is\nspecified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is\ndemonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for\nmore detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for\ndistributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs\nboson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing\nthat enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious\nselection of events.\n", "title": "Calculation of prompt diphoton production cross sections at Tevatron and\n  LHC energies", "authors": "C.

{"abstract": "  Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hya\nin quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial\nvelocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first\ntime in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600\nkm/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the\nouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion\ncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler\ntomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending\nfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the\ntheoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and\nNorton et al.

{"abstract": "  This paper considers the propagation of shallow-water solitary and nonlinear\nperiodic waves over a gradual slope with bottom friction in the framework of a\nvariable-coefficient Korteweg-de Vries equation. We use the Whitham averaging\nmethod, using a recent development of this theory for perturbed integrable\nequations. This general approach enables us not only to improve known results\non the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains\nin the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the\nChezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the\npropagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system\nunder consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of\nvariable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global\nrestrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the\nleading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated\nsolitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to\nnonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an\nadditional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the\nframework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary\nwaves in slowly varying media.\n", "title": "Evolution of solitary waves and undular bores in shallow-water flows\n  over a gradual slope with bottom friction", "authors": "G.A.

For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin\na=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits\nwhose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect\nto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.\nThis behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite\nto the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted\npreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to\nthe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysis\ngeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)\nfamily of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits\nreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming\norbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial\nconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing\norbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial\nconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the\nearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly\nhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes\nbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to\nequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for\neccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits.

The relative contributions from these spin\ndecoherence mechanisms are compared in detail. In our calculation, the\nspin-orbit coupling is included in each mechanism and is shown to have marked\neffect in most cases. The equation-of-motion approach is applied in studying\nboth the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and the spin dephasing time $T_2$, either\nin Markovian or in non-Markovian limit. When many levels are involved at finite\ntemperature, we demonstrate how to obtain the spin relaxation time from the\nFermi Golden rule in the limit of weak spin-orbit coupling. However, at high\ntemperature and/or for large spin-orbit coupling, one has to use the\nequation-of-motion approach when many levels are involved. Moreover, spin\ndephasing can be much more efficient than spin relaxation at high temperature,\nthough the two only differs by a factor of two at low temperature.\n", "title": "Reexamination of spin decoherence in semiconductor quantum dots from\n  equation-of-motion approach", "authors": "J.

{"abstract": "  The magnetic and thermodynamic properties of spin-1/2 Heisenberg diamond\nchains are investigated in three different cases: (a) J1, J2, J3>0\n(frustrated); (b) J1, J3<0, J2>0 (frustrated); and (c) J1, J2>0, J3<0\n(non-frustrated). The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique is\ninvoked to study the properties of the system in the ground state, while the\ntransfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explore\nthe thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlation\nfunctions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state for\nthe three cases. It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaks\nat wavevectors $q=a\\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zero\nmagnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetization\nplateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\\pi /3$ and\n$4\\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent. The DMRG results of the\nzero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linear\nsuperposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It is\nobserved that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of\nthe system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of the\nsusceptibility and specific heat against temperature are obtained, where the\npeak positions and heights are found to depend on the competition of the\ncouplings. It is also uncovered that the XXZ anisotropy of F and AF couplings\nleads the system of case (c) to display quite different behaviors.

{"abstract": "  The extraction of a physical law y=yo(x) from joint experimental data about x\nand y is treated. The joint, the marginal and the conditional probability\ndensity functions (PDF) are expressed by given data over an estimator whose\nkernel is the instrument scattering function. As an optimal estimator of yo(x)\nthe conditional average is proposed. The analysis of its properties is based\nupon a new definition of prediction quality. The joint experimental information\nand the redundancy of joint measurements are expressed by the relative entropy.\nWith the number of experiments the redundancy on average increases, while the\nexperimental information converges to a certain limit value. The difference\nbetween this limit value and the experimental information at a finite number of\ndata represents the discrepancy between the experimentally determined and the\ntrue properties of the phenomenon. The sum of the discrepancy measure and the\nredundancy is utilized as a cost function. By its minimum a reasonable number\nof data for the extraction of the law yo(x) is specified. The mutual\ninformation is defined by the marginal and the conditional PDFs of the\nvariables. The ratio between mutual information and marginal information is\nused to indicate which variable is the independent one.
